Usage:

        # run lxHive service
        docker run --name lxhive -p 8080:80 -v mongodb-data:/var/lib/mongodb -v lxhive-storage:/lxHive/storage pchampin/lxhive

        # run ./X command for configuration
        docker exec -it lxhive ./X [args]

NB: MongoDB takes a long time to really start,
so get patient if apache does not start right away.

Note that, in order to actually use LxHive,
you will have to use ./X user:create and ./X auth:basic:create.
